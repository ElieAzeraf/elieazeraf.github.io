I hold two MSc degrees — one in Financial Engineering and one in Statistics — as well as a Ph.D. in Statistics.

Over the past 7 years, I've worked as an AI expert at IBM and Capgemini, applying machine learning and statistical modeling to solve complex problems.

Today, I'm the founder of [Azeraf Financial Consulting](https://www.azeraf-financial-consulting.com/), where I help individuals and professionals build optimized stock portfolios based on their risk profiles and investment goals.
